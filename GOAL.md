# Goal

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple application that allows
the user to create post-it notes, edit their text and drag them around.
When they come back to the page later, the post-its should still be there.
The post-its can be categorized into 4 categories:
- Good
- Bad
- Start
- Stop
